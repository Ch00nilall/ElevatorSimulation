# Elevator Simulation

## Description
This is a C# console application that simulates the movement of elevators within a large building. The goal of the application is to optimize passenger transportation efficiently. The simulation adheres to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including SOLID principles, for modularity and maintainability.

The key features of this elevator simulation include:

1. Real-Time Elevator Status:
   - Displays the real-time status of each elevator, including its current floor, direction of movement, whether it's in motion or stationary, and the number of passengers it is carrying.

2. Interactive Elevator Control:
   - Allows users to interact with the elevators through the console application.
   - Users can call an elevator to a specific floor and indicate the number of passengers waiting on each floor.

3. Multiple Floors and Elevators Support:
   - Designed to accommodate buildings with multiple floors and multiple elevators.
   - Elevators can efficiently move between different floors.

4. Efficient Elevator Dispatching:
   - Implements an algorithm that efficiently directs the nearest available elevator to respond to an elevator request.
   - Minimizes wait times for passengers and optimizes elevator usage.

5. Passenger Limit Handling:
   - Considers the maximum passenger limit for each elevator.
   - Prevents the elevator from becoming overloaded and handles scenarios where additional elevators might be required.

6. Consideration for Different Elevator Types (Future Extension):
   - The architecture is designed to accommodate future extensions for different elevator types, such as high-speed elevators, glass elevators, and freight elevators.

7. Real-Time Operation:
   - The console application operates in real-time, providing immediate responses to user interactions and accurately reflecting elevator movements and status.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution in your preferred C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).
3. Build and run the application.

## Instructions
1. Upon running the application, you will see the current status of each elevator.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the elevators:
   - Enter the target floor (1-10) where you want to call an elevator.
   - Enter the passenger count for the elevator. 
   - The nearest available elevator will be dispatched to your specified floor.
   - Elevator status and passenger movement will be displayed in real-time.

## Configuration
You can configure the elevator simulation by modifying parameters in the code, such as the number of elevators, the number of floors.

## Dependencies
The application utilizes C# and .NET Core libraries. No external dependencies are required.
